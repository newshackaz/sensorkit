## What is this?
This python script will blink an LED programatically. The means you can control exactly how the LED blinks using software.

## Instructions:
1. Start with an LED, a resistor, and your Raspberry Pi.
2. Using a breadboard and/or jumper cables, connect the positive end of the LED to GPIO pin 17.
3. Connect the negative end of the LED to a resister
4. Connect the resistor to any ground pin on the Raspberry Pi
5. Run the script led.py with this command: `python led.py`
6. The script should run forever. To stop the script, type `ctrl + a` at the same time.

## Playing around:
Right now the script blinks on and off each second. How might you speed this up or slow it down? How might you change its rythm from regular, to irregular?
