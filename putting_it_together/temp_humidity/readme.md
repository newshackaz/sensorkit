## What is this?

In this project we'll hook up a temperature and humidity sensor. It's a cool sensor because it's really TWO sensors in one: temperature and humidity. We'll have to use some different coding techniques here because the manufacturer has provided us with a special Python library for interfacing with the sensor. A lot of manufacturers will do this, and it usually makes using the sensor simpler, not harder. So look for sensors with custom libraries when shopping for your own hardware.

## Instructions:
1. Start with the Adafruit DHT-22 temperature/humidity sensor
2. Using a breadboard and jumper cables, first connect the the 3.3v connector on the Raspberry Pi to one end of a 10k ohm resistor.
3. Using a jumper cable, connect that same end of the resistor to the positive lead of the sensor (the other end of the resistor should still be unconnected to anything)
4. Connect the negative end of the sensor
